# spark-devplugins

Apache Spark is a highly extensible framework. It has given multiple plugin points to customize the behavior. Some of the plugins are well known. But many of them are developer oriented and are not documented. [This work in spark-devplugins git repository](https://github.com/falarica/spark-devplugins) is about demonstrating those extensions using small and meaningful examples. 

Every project in [spark-devplugins](https://github.com/falarica/spark-devplugins) repo demonstrates a plugin with an example. There is associated documentation for each of those plugins. In the git repo, tests for the plugins are also added. The tests not only tests the project but also demonstrates the behavior of the plugin in a detailed way. 

Currently, the repo is built with Spark 2.3.1.

Documentation can be found [here.](https://falarica.github.io/spark-devplugins)
